# Introduction to Haskell
This repo contains source code from my answers to the exercises proposed in Brent Yorgey's [CIS 194(Spring 2013): Introduction to Haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/index.html) course.

I decided to try this because of a [recommendation](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell) by [@bitemyapp](http://github.com/bitemyapp)

The course is very well structured from a didatic point of view and I surely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn some Haskell.
