# Introduction to Haskell Solutions
These are the answers of me attempting to work through Brent Yorgey's [CIS 194(Spring 2013): Introduction to Haskell](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/index.html)

I decided to try this because of a recommendation by [@bitemyapp](http://github.com/bitemyapp)

Link to the recommendation: https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell
